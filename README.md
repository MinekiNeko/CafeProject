# CafeProject

Started 9/6/2021
So I have ideas for this but I haven't drawn them out or anything. It's been a while since I did a website project for myself so I'm starting one right before school... yay.... Anyway I'm probably going to have to make more websites with actual people b/c of the classes I want to take so this likely is going to be forgotten but I'll start it out anyway. Maybe I can use it to *sparkles* learn *sparkles*. that's all from me for now then its a passion project that probably won't go anywhere :))

i learned a thing how to use multiple accounts today. remember to delete credentials first. therefore this probably can't be worked on during school simply for convenience reasons. also learning about how to edit readme file in text editor, still a wip
